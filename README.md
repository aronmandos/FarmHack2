This HTML file combined with Javascript creates a Polygon at given GEOLocations.
A marker is placed at the edge of the Polygon and moves slowly in a given direction.
Within the Polygon a user can place a Point Of Interest which is represented by a circle.
If the marker crosses this circle it will create a alert which says it has taken a photograph.
